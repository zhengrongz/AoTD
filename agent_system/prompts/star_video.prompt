Write a function using Python and the functions (above) that could be executed to provide an answer to the query. 

Consider the following guidelines:
- Use base Python (comparison, sorting) for basic logical operations, start/end, math, etc.
- Objects with mutiple names like "phone/camera", "cup/glass/bottle" with slash, input them as a whole object name!!
- Just use the class and function appear above except for some base python operations.
- Only answer with a function starting def execute_command, don't answer any extra words and symbols before and after the function!!!!
- No text that is not related to function can appear!!
- the answer only begins with "def execute_command" and ends with "return answer"!!!!!!
- Do not use extra unnecessary indentation!!

Here are some examples of the function you should write:
